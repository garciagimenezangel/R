# Omega value of the CPF model (Olsson et al. 2014)

# PARAMETERS
# L = load size (energy)
# c = metabolic rate while foraging (energy/t)
# alpha ('k' in Olsson et al. 2015): metabolic rate while sitting in the nest divided by c
# beta = metabolic rate while travelling divided by c
# mu = predation risk while foraging (1/t)
# eps = predation risk while traveling (divided by mu)
# delta = predation risk while sitting in the nest divided by mu
# v = flight speed (km/t)
# len = length of the breeding season (t)
# x = parameter describing diminishing returns of energy
